An IoT device deployed across buildings to continuously measure structural tilt and identify areas requiring maintenance or repair. The system uses MEMS sensors and wireless connectivity to send real-time tilt data to a cloud dashboard, enabling early detection of dangerous structural shifts and helping facility teams take preventive action.
